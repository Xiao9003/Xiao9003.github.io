A phenazine derivative with a succinimide endcap (PHS) was designed and synthesized for cysteine (Cys) with near-infrared (NIR) emission. Upon the addition of Cys, the color of the solution changed clearly from greenish black to orange, which was attributed to the disappeared absorbance at 616 nm. An enhanced NIR emission band at 670 nm was found in the fluorescence spectra and a corresponding excitation peak at 466 nm arose in the excitation spectra. Verified by the dynamic reaction, the cyanoacetic acid moiety should be susceptible to be attacked by the –SH group in a fast rate through Michael addition reaction. Being highly reactive to the amino group (–NH2), the NHS-active carbonyl site could target the amino acid and accelerate the process of nucleophilic attack from the –SH group. This cycloaddition mechanism of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl NHS-ester was proved by 1H NMR titration. In …

The optical monitoring of thiols such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) is of significant interest due to their crucial roles in maintaining the biological redox homeostasis through the equilibrium of free thiols and oxidized disulfides in biological systems. In this work, a molecular chemodosimeter DPP-DNBS with a highly photostable diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) fluorophore connected to a 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNBS) electron-withdrawing group for selective detection of biothiols was effectively synthesized. The specific reaction between biological thiols and DPP-DNBS gives rise to an obvious fluorescence intensity enhancement at 615 nm which is induced by the cleavage of Osingle bondS bond liberates DPP fluorophore. High sensitivity and selectivity for pathless over other amino acids were also obtained. Moreover, via turn-on signal toward cysteine in Hela cells, DPP-DNBS was …

A molecular chemodosimeter PHSN, with a naphthalimide fluorophore connected to a newly designed phenazine energy acceptor, for the selective detection of cysteine was effectively synthesized. PHSN featured efficient intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on spectral overlap between the emission of naphthalimide and the absorption of phenazine. A cystamine chain with a S–S bond was applied to play the role of recognition moiety and the linker part. The specific reaction between the biological thiols and PHSN gave rise to an obvious fluorescence intensity enhancement at 540 nm, which is induced by cleavage of the disulfide bond followed by elimination of the FRET effect. High sensitivity and selectivity for cysteine over homocysteine and glutathione were also achieved. In addition, upon excitation at 400 nm, a relatively weak NIR emission provided an internal standard …

Two chemodosimeters PDMI and PMI for cyanide detection were designed and synthesized based on phenazine-cyanine dyes with N-methyl indolium group as receptor unit. According to the specific reactivity of indolium Cdouble bondN+ bond against cyanide anion, both of them featured high sensitivity with detection limit of 1.4 μM and 200 nM, respectively, and high selectivity against other anions. The quenching effect on phenazine-cyanine fluorophore by strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from phenazine donor to indolium receptor made both PDMI and PMI non-emissive at the original state. After addition of cyanide, the ICT effect decreased and vanished leading to dramatic “off–on” fluorescence enhancement. PDMI which proceeded bilateral electrophilic reaction toward cyanide anion provided an emission signal at 580 nm in HEPES buffer with naked-eye detectable color change. Probe PMI utilized …

Citrate is an important intermediate in the citric acid cycle, a vital metabolic pathway for animals, plants and bacteria. It is of great significance to detect its levels in human beings because several diseases may cause the abnormal of citrate. In this paper, a new turn-on fluorescent sensor (TPE-Py) using the classic tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophore and bipyridinium-based amides as the recognition receptor has been synthesized for the detection of citrate. The probe exhibits good selectivity and sensitivity to citrate with a relatively low detection limit (1.0 × 10−7 M). The enhancement of the fluorescence is relevant with the AIE property based on the complexation of TPE-Py with citrate caused by the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions between the bipyridinium diamides and citrate, which has been proved by 1H NMR and mass spectra titration, scanning …

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a highly effective oxidant produced during phagocytosis and plays an important role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In this work, a new ratiometric fluorescent probe (PTZ-TDPP) based on a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and phenothiazine platform, was firstly designed and synthesized for the selective detection of HOCl. PTZ-TDPP showed an obvious color change from purple to pink along with a distinct fluorescence change from bright red to yellow in response to HOCl. The limit of detection towards HOCl was calculated to be 190 nM. For biological applications, PTZ-TDPP is of great development potential in detecting endogenous HOCl in living RAW 264.7 cells. A co-localization study employing MitoTracker Green showed that PTZ-TDPP was specifically located in the mitochondria of RAW 264.7 cells. Therefore, PTZ-TDPP has great potential for the detection of …

A new turn-on near-infrared fluorescence probe (BDP) based on dibenzo[a,c]phenazine for superoxide anion detection with aggregation-induced emission properties as well as a desirable large Stokes shift was designed and synthesized. After BDP reacted with superoxide, the initial diphenyl-phosphinyl groups of BDP were cleaved, resulting in the production of the pyridinium modified fluorophore (BD) with near-infrared emission. The fluorescent sensor BDP has a high selectivity for superoxide anions over some other intracellular ROSs, reductants, metal ions and amino acids. When HepG2 cells undergo apoptosis and inflammation, BDP is a good probe to keep track of the endogenous superoxide anion level by confocal laser scanning microscopic imaging.

As non-invasive diagnosis and therapy methods, photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention. Herein, two new acceptor–donor–acceptor near-infrared organic phenazine-cyanine dyes PH-1 and PH-2 were reported for photoacoustic imaging-guided photodynamic therapy. In the strong donor phenazine molecule, the electron-withdrawing indole salt unit was introduced for absorption to the near-infrared region. To improve water solubility, the two organic dyes were assembled with human serum albumin (HSA) to form nanoparticles of appropriate sizes, i.e., PH-1@HSA and PH-2@HSA, which showed excellent stability in both weakly acidic and weakly basic environments. Moreover, the results showed that PH-1@HSA and PH-2@HSA nanoparticles can effectively transform luminous energy to thermal energy in vitro and in vivo, and they can be utilized for PA …

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a representative reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play important roles in signaling and homeostasis. And it is also an important cobleaching agent and disinfectant in industry and life. Therefore, it is of significant importance to detect HOCl accurately for the diagnosis or treatment of various diseases and the protection of the environment. Considering its excellent photophysical properties, N-annulated perylene (NP) was chosen as the fluorophore to design a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the sensitive and selective detection of HOCl for the first time. Benefiting from the introduction of a piperazine moiety, the probe became pH-sensitive due to the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. In a neutral environment, PNPM was a turn-on probe towards HOCl with a limit of detection of 31.7 nM. However, PNPM became a ratiometric fluorescent probe under weakly acidic …

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) serves an effective role in biological systems as the acknowledged third endogenous gasotransmitter, so it makes great sense to detect and analyze H2S sensitively and quantitatively in subcellular environments, such as in mitochondria and lysosomes where H2S is widespread and functions as the mediator. Considering the excellent photophysical properties and multiple modification sites, N-annulated perylene (NP) was firstly chosen as the fluorophore to design a series of colorimetric and ratiometric near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for the sensitive and selective detection of H2S. The probes showed near-infrared fluorescence at 681 nm in the absence of H2S. But with the addition of H2S, the NIR fluorescence decreased sharply and a new fluorescence peak at approximately 481 nm dramatically increased in a short response time, which could be clearly observed using the naked …

A new fluorescent probe (DPP-AC) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole with an acrylate group was designed and synthesized for the sensitive and selective detection of biological thiols. The acrylate group of DPP-AC as the receptor moiety displayed obvious ratiometric changes from red to yellow upon the addition of cysteine (Cys), and the change in fluorescence ratio (I552/I664) was over 20-fold. The limit of detection towards Cys was calculated as 84 nM; much lower than the normal concentration in living cells. More importantly, DPP-AC had outstanding selectivity towards cysteine over homocysteine (Hcy), glutathione (GSH) and other amino acids. DPP-AC was successfully employed to detect endogenous Cys in Hela cells and discriminate Cys from Hcy and GSH in living cells.
