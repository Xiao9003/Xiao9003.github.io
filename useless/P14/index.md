A chemodosimeter toward cyanide based on phenazine disulfonylindole (PDSI) was designed and synthesized. PDSI expressed obvious intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption band at 750 nm. After the addition of cyanide, the C= N+ double bond was broken and neutralized and this ICT band dramatically decreased for the decreasing electron-withdrawing ability of indole moiety. Color change from green to light yellow could be observed which indicated that PDSI can realize real naked-eye detection of cyanide anion. On the other hand, a turn-on fluorescence signal was appeared after adding cyanide. The maximum emission band at 580 nm increased and achieved above 20-fold enhancement. Also, PDSI provided high sensitivity and selectivity with a low detection limit (20 nmol/L) which is below the maximum contaminant level for cyanide (MCL) in drinking water (0.02 ppm) set by the United States …
