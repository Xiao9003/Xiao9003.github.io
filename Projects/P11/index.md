The optical monitoring of thiols such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) is of significant interest due to their crucial roles in maintaining the biological redox homeostasis through the equilibrium of free thiols and oxidized disulfides in biological systems. In this work, a molecular chemodosimeter DPP-DNBS with a highly photostable diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) fluorophore connected to a 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl (DNBS) electron-withdrawing group for selective detection of biothiols was effectively synthesized. The specific reaction between biological thiols and DPP-DNBS gives rise to an obvious fluorescence intensity enhancement at 615 nm which is induced by the cleavage of Osingle bondS bond liberates DPP fluorophore. High sensitivity and selectivity for pathless over other amino acids were also obtained. Moreover, via turn-on signal toward cysteine in Hela cells, DPP-DNBS was â€¦
