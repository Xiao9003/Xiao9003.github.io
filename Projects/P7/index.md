Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a representative reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play important roles in signaling and homeostasis. And it is also an important cobleaching agent and disinfectant in industry and life. Therefore, it is of significant importance to detect HOCl accurately for the diagnosis or treatment of various diseases and the protection of the environment. Considering its excellent photophysical properties, N-annulated perylene (NP) was chosen as the fluorophore to design a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the sensitive and selective detection of HOCl for the first time. Benefiting from the introduction of a piperazine moiety, the probe became pH-sensitive due to the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. In a neutral environment, PNPM was a turn-on probe towards HOCl with a limit of detection of 31.7 nM. However, PNPM became a ratiometric fluorescent probe under weakly acidic â€¦
